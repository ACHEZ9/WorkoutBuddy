<p>Have you ever wanted to get out and be active, play a game of basketball or tennis, go rock climbing, or take a hike, but haven’t been able to find anyone to go with? Many activities require, if not are much more enjoyable with one, two, or a group of other people. Friends can be busy, uninterested, and tough to coordinate.</p>

<p>Our application will make it easy to find other people to play sports and do physical activities, plan games and group events, and make it so there is always someone that wants to get out and be active like you.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works</h2>

<p>Sign in to the application, and search for events that people are planning on doing based on the type of activity, location, time, or skill level. Want to play a game of pickup basketball this Saturday afternoon? Go on and search with the tag basketball, set the time for Saturday between 11am - 2pm, and within 5 miles of your location. Results will show any events matching that query, and if there isn’t anything that fits what you are looking for, you can create their own activity, and others will be able to join in.</p>

<p>Users will create profiles where they can set what activities they are interested in and times they are free, and will be notified if activities are created that match their preferences.</p>
